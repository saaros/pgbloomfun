pgbloomfun
==========

pgbloomfun is an implementation of bloom filter functions for PostgreSQL.
This extension only provides a couple of simple functions for using bloom
filters on bytea variables and does not include indexing or other features
provided by Teodor's and Oleg's bloom index
(http://www.sai.msu.su/~megera/wiki/bloom)

Example usage:

  CREATE TABLE bloomtest (hits INT, bloom BYTEA);
  INSERT INTO bloomtest VALUES (0, bloom_init(1000, 0.01));
  DO $$
    DECLARE ctr INT;
    BEGIN
      FOR ctr IN 1..1000 LOOP
        UPDATE bloomtest
        SET hits = hits + 1,
            bloom = bloom_add(bloom, ctr::text)
        WHERE bloom_check(bloom, ctr::text) IS FALSE;
      END LOOP;
    END;
  $$;
  SELECT hits FROM bloomtest;

Bloom filter implementation is based on Jyri J. Virkki's libbloom
(https://github.com/jvirkki/libbloom) and the MurmurHash3 is from SMHasher
by Austin Appleby (https://code.google.com/p/smhasher/).
